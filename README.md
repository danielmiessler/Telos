## Purpose

The purpose of the Telos project is to help entities of any size—from individuals to planets—articulate what they are about and how they're pursuing their purpose in life.

It provides a structured framework for capturing the main components of an entity, including its mission, goals, problems, strategies, KPIs, etc.

## Content

The current content of the Telos framework is a file called [`corporate_telos.md`](corporate_telos.md), which is a Telos Context File (TCF) that contains the context for a fictional company called Alma.

The file is for the company's Information Security Program, and covers everything about the program, from its mission to its goals, strategies, tech stack, remediation metrics, etc.

## How to Contribute

The best way to contribute today is to add an Issue to the repo with your ideas, suggestions, or requests. And I can use that to update the file structure described in #Content.
